Toolkit to test integration with Belgian NSSO

- XML formatting
- XSD validation

## How to use

- Install the Chrome extension.
-- Click the extension icon to open the main screen OR
-- On any Chrome page, select some text and use the context menu to "Analyze NSSO XML"

or
- Open the main.html directly

- XSD-files are cached into local storage. If the NSSO updates an xsd's content, you should 'Reset XSD-cache' to force getting the new file.
